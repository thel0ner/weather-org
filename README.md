# weather-org
This is a "simple" angular application which interacts with openweathermap.org APIs., draws graphs using Highcharts and information retrived from openweathermap.

This project is devided in to two seperate directories called FE - Front End - and BE - backend.
the backend section has nothing special except a simple script which records demanded reports and shows them back when needed. 
for sure, the backend part should never, ever considered for a live project! this is just a demo script.
the main focus have been on frontend side, where angular interacts with openweathermap.org APIs.
